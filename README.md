## üîπ Quick Start
@egjs/view3d requires one wrapper & one canvas element to be initialized.

```html
<div id="view3d" class="view3d-wrapper">
  <canvas class="my-canvas"></canvas>
</div>
```

Then you can use it like

```js
import View3D from "@egjs/view3d";
import "@egjs/view3d/css";

const canvasEl = document.querySelector("#view3d");
const view3d = new View3D(canvasEl, {
  src: "URL_TO_YOUR_3D_MODEL",
  envmap: "URL_TO_YOUR_HDR_IMAGE",
});

// or just

const view3d = new View3D("#view3d");
```
