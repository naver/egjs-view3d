Plugins are set of optional UI components that adds additional ability to View3D.

## Adding plugins
Plugins can be added in two ways.

1. Add plugins before initialization with the option [plugins](/docs/options/miscellaneous/plugins)

```js
import { LoadingBar } from "@egjs/view3d";

const view3D = new View3D("#el_id", {
  plugins: [new LoadingBar()]
})
```

2. Add plugins at anytime with [loadPlugins](/docs/api/View3D#loadPlugins)

```js
import { LoadingBar } from "@egjs/view3d";

const view3D = new View3D("#el_id");

view3D.loadPlugins(new LoadingBar());
```

## Removing plugins
Plugins can be removed at anytime by calling [removePlugins](/docs/api/View3D#removePlugins).
Otherwise, they will be removed when View3D's [destroy](/docs/api/View3D#destroy) is called.

```js
import { LoadingBar } from "@egjs/view3d";

const plugin = new LoadingBar();
const view3D = new View3D("#el_id", {
  plugins: [plugin]
});

// Remove loading bar
view3D.removePlugins(plugin);
```
