Event handlers can be added in two ways.

1. Add event handlers before initialization with the option [on](/docs/options/miscellaneous/on)

```js
const view3D = new View3D("#el", {
  on: {
    ready: evt => {
      // DO_SOMETHING
    }
  }
});
```

2. Add event handlers at anytime with `on`, `once`

```js
const view3D = new View3D("#el");

view3D.on("load", evt => {
  // This will be called everytime when the 3D model is loaded
});

view3D.once("load", evt => {
  // This will be called once for the first loaded model.
});
```

You can detach these handlers at anytime by calling `off`.

```js
const view3D = new View3D("#el");

const handler = () => {
  console.log("render");
};

// Attach handler
view3D.on("render", handler);

// Detach handler
view3D.off("render", handler);
```
