<OptionDescriptor type="string | string[] | null" defaultVal="null" />

Source URL to fetch 3D model. `glb` / `glTF` models are supported.
If an array is given, it will load and display the models in the given order.

## Example
### Single
<View3D
  src="/egjs-view3d/model/draco/alarm.glb"
  envmap="/egjs-view3d/texture/artist_workshop_1k.hdr"
  showExampleCode />

### LOD(Level of Detail) applied
View3D will load and display all 3D models given in the `src` array sequentially.
You can use this behavior to load 3D model with smaller size, which can decrease time to interactive.

:::info
Test this example with the network throttling applied.
