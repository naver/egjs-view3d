URL to [Meshoptimizer](https://github.com/zeux/meshoptimizer) decoder js path.

It adds an ability to decode 3D models with [EXT_meshopt_compression](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/blob/main/extensions/2.0/Vendor/EXT_meshopt_compression/README.md) enabled.
Decoder will be loaded on View3D's initialization, so you should set decoder path before initialization.
It's `null` by default, which means it won't handle such models.
Quick fix is to use the CDN below.

```
https://unpkg.com/meshoptimizer@0.17.0/meshopt_decoder.js
```

Similar to Draco, meshopt can compress the geometry data of the 3D model.
The table below compares the before and after compression of the example model below.

|Model|Before Compression|After Compression (Used [gltfpack](https://github.com/zeux/meshoptimizer/tree/master/gltf)'s -tc -cc flag)|
|---|:---:|:---:|
|Vintage Pocket Watch|5.95MB|1.37MB (-76.97%)|


:::caution

Note that SceneViewer AR session can't handle models with `EXT_meshopt_compression` enabled.
