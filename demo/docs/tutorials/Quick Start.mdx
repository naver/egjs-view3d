## DOM Structure
View3D requires appropriate DOM structure for initialization.
There should be one `canvas` element inside the wrapper element.

```html
<div id="wrapper-el" class="view3d-wrapper view3d-square">
  <canvas class="view3d-canvas"></canvas>
</div>
```
```js
new View3D("#wrapper-el");
```

All class names are optional, but it's needed when you're using our CSS files.

### Ratio helper classes
The class `view3d-square`(or `view3d-1by1`) will set the height of canvas element same to its width.
You can use one of our other pre-defined classes to set responsive canvas height with fixed ratio.

```
view3d-square
view3d-1by1
view3d-5by4
view3d-4by3
view3d-3by2
view3d-5by3
view3d-16by9
view3d-2by1
view3d-3by1
view3d-4by5
view3d-3by4
view3d-2by3
view3d-3by5
view3d-9by16
view3d-1by2
view3d-1by3
```

You can also can set canvas width/height without ratio class but with CSS like this, and View3D will follow.
```css
.view3d-wrapper {
  width: 100%;
  height: 100vh;
}
```

## Setup Script & Styles
<Tabs
  groupId="quick-start"
  defaultValue="bundler"
  lazy={true}
  values={[
    { label: "With bundlers", value: "bundler" },
    { label: "Without bundlers", value: "non-bundler" }
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="bundler">

```js
import View3D from "@egjs/view3d";
import "@egjs/view3d/css/bundle";
// or import "@egjs/view3d/css"; if you don't use any plugins

const view3D = new View3D("#view3d", {
  // Options
})
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="non-bundler">

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@egjs/view3d@latest/dist/view3d.pkgd.min.js"></script>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/@egjs/view3d@latest/dist/view3d-bundle.min.css">
```

```js
const view3D = new View3D("#view3d", {
  // Options
})
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Displaying a model
3D model will be displayed on the canvas if you set the option `src`.

<View3D
  src="/model/draco/alarm.glb"
  showExampleCode />

But as there's no lighting yet, model will be shown in black (unless it has emissive property enabled)
View3D uses HDR image as envmap for IBL(image-based lighting), so you can set any HDR image for the option `envmap` and model will be litten.

<View3D
  src="/model/draco/alarm.glb"
  envmap="/texture/artist_workshop_1k.hdr"
  showExampleCode />
